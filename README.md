Exploratory Data Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

Cleaned & analyzed the AQI data from Indian government on Kaggle with 16 columns and 25K+ rows using pandas and numpy

Used tools like geopandas, matplotlib and  seaborn to visualize the data on the AQI and gaseous pollutants in Indiaâ€™s Cities.

I discovered Ahemedabad is the India city with the worst Air Quality Index (AQI) and the severe AQI is reducing while the good AQI is increasing across Indian cities.
