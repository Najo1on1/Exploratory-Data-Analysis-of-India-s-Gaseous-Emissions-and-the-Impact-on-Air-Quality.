# ðŸ“ˆExploring India's Air Quality (2015-2020)

This project is an in-depth exploration of air quality across multiple cities in India, spanning from 2015 to 2020. Using data on various pollutants, it aims to uncover trends, assess air quality levels, and provide insights into the environmental challenges faced by these urban areas.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset includes measurements for the following pollutants:
- PM2.5 and PM10
- Nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, and NOx)
- Ammonia (NH3)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)
- Sulfur dioxide (SO2)
- Ozone (O3)
- Volatile organic compounds (Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene)

Air Quality Index (AQI) values are also provided, categorized into different buckets indicating the air quality levels from "Good" to "Hazardous".

### Insights and Analysis

Through detailed data visualization and analysis, the notebook presents a city-wise breakdown of pollutant levels, trends over the years, and seasonal variations in air quality. Key findings include:
- Variability in pollutant levels across different cities and over time.
- Identification of cities with consistently poor air quality.
- Analysis of the impact of seasons and specific events (e.g., festivals, government policies) on air quality.

### Tools and Techniques

The project utilizes Python for data analysis, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. The approach includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend analysis, and visual representation of findings.

### Conclusion

This analysis offers valuable insights into the air quality trends across major Indian cities, highlighting the need for continued environmental monitoring and policies aimed at reducing pollution levels.
